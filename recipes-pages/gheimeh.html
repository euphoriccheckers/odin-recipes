        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gheimeh is a comforting Persian stew cooked with beef and yellow split peas. This stew is super fragrant with melt-in-your-mouth meat cooked to perfection with earthy spices like cinnamon and turmeric. Like most Iranian stews, this stew is served with fluffy saffron rice.</p>
